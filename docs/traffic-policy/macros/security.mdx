title: Security Macros
---

Security Macros allow you to access sensitive information directly in your Traffic Policies. Your ngrok account has a Vault that can store Secrets. Any secrets that you add to your vault will be available across your account on all traffic policies. Updates to these secrets will be reflected across all traffic policies automatically.

## How secrets are secured

- Secrets are protected at rest using industry standard AES-256 encryption
- ngrok's REST API does not return secrets as part of any of its response payloads
- REST API traffic is encrypted in-transit using HTTP/S and TLS 1.2+`

## Pricing and limits

Each vault and secret is free. Price per action is TBD.
